# Week 5- Technigo Bootcamp

# Project Guess-Who
This week's project is about creating a digital version of the old character guessing board game Guess Who?
Have been set up most of the styling and HTML structure as well as some functions to start with, so the focus is as much as possible on the JavaScript part. Of course, is free to change whatever part. The repo was a fork from https://github.com/Technigo/project-guess-who


## The problem

The development started understanding the game itself and its rules. Then was necessary to analyze the structure of HTML and JavaScript to understand the relationship between elements, event listeners, and functions.

I tried to accomplished every part of the logic by myself, without reading the instructions.  That helped to get my own approach to the javascript part. I started with the filter part according to every question and then I developed the logic about the win and lose section, finally, I added a name input, a counter, and a timer. It requires reading about how to create these functions like setIntervarl, clearInterval, parseInt, etc. 

I also tried to refactor the code to made it more concise and clear and added some comments related to those changes. 

It was an interesting practice to start understanding better arrays and objects in JavaScript.
